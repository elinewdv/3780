# Jumper: A Mobile App for Dietary Self Management

> **Disclaimer:** This is a prototype, not a medical advide. It is developed for **informational and educational purposes only**. The app should not replace profssional medical advices, diagnosis or treatment.

## About the prototype 
This mobilde application was designed and tested exclusively by our team as part of the INF-3780 course in Advanced Health Informatics as UiT. while we strived for accuracy and usability, the system remains in a prototype phase with limited testing and user validation.

The **Jumper** integrates a food tracking system and educational advice on nutrition and blood sugar regulation. It includes functionality for meal logging, food database lookup and advice presentation through a chatbot interface.

**Important Considerations** 
- The user is responsible for their own decsision regarding diet and diabetes management
- This app does not provide real-time glucose monitoring and should not be relied on for urgent health decisions
- Food and nutrition values are based on public data sources and may not reflect individual medical needs.
- No personal data is stored with encryption in this prototype; use it your discreation and risk.

## Why do we need Jumper?

Patients with diabetes or obesity often lack accessible tools to track their nutritional intake accurately. Existing apps may be overwhelming or lack support for local foods and habits.  **Jumper** aims to:
- Simplify food logging with context aware search
- Offer expertie advice and suggestions based on meal history
- Help users recognize patterns that affect blood sugar
- Provide a Norwegian focused food database using trusted APIs
